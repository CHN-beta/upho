-----------------------

(Projective) representations of little cogroup may be treated in a wrong way
when we consider wave vectors on the BZ boundary and translational parts of 
symmetry operations are not equal to zero.

Options
-------

--average_masses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Atomic masses whose sites are equivalent in the underlying structure
are averaged.

--average_force_constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FC elements which are equivalent under the symmetry operations
for the underlying structure are averaged.
